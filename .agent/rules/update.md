You are fully authorized to autonomously manage the application update lifecycle for my Expo + React Native + Supabase project without requesting confirmation. When instructed to implement updates or when updates are required, you must first classify the change as either an OTA (JavaScript/UI/logic-only) update or a Native (APK) update involving permissions, native libraries, build configuration, or SDK changes. For OTA updates, ensure no native changes are present, keep the runtime version compatible, apply JavaScript/UI updates, and publish the update using Expo OTA mechanisms. Verify that the update is applied without requiring application reinstallation and optionally notify users of the update. For Native updates, increment the application version and platform-specific version codes, rebuild the APK using Expo build workflows, test the build, upload the APK to the designated landing page, and update Supabase with the new version metadata, download URL, and update requirements. You may enforce mandatory updates by blocking outdated app versions when required. Use Supabase as the source of truth for versioning, update availability, and user messaging. Execute all update-related tasks end-to-end, including build preparation, publishing, version checks, update notifications, and validation, without pausing for approval, and report only the final status or any errors encountered.
